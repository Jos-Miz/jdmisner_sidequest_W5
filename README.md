## Description

This p5.js project is a side-scrolling space platformer. The player controls a yellow blob and travels across a world that is larger than the screen. The goal is to navigate platforms and collect a hidden star before it reaches Earth. The camera follows the player, gradually revealing the environment as they move. When the star is collected, an ending screen appears celebrating that Earth has been saved. The project demonstrates camera movement, world scaling and collision detection.

## Learning Goals

- Create a world larger than the visible canvas
- Implement a side-scrolling camera system
- Use pacing and spacing to control player experience
- Hide and detect interactive objects (the star)
- Manage different game states (splash, play, end)

## GenAI

GenAI (ChatGPT 5.2) was used to assist with debugging, implementing visuals, and understanding where code changes should be made within the provided structure. All final design decisions, logic, and testing were completed by myself (In my process documentation).
